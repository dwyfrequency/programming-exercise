## Summary

Overall, this was a fun exercise. I've included some suggestions for future candidates:

- ask candidates to do a more thorough check for validating a csv. For example, they should craft some regex to escape special characters in words like necessary commas. (think address)
- adding a configurable delimiter would be easy, but interesting to see how they would implement it.
- ask them to implement units tests
- be explicit on whether you want them to dynamically generate the column headers. I assumed that we could just pass them in as a function parameter, but I may be wrong.
